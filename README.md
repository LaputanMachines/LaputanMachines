My name is Michael, and I'm many things. I work a day-job as a devops engineer. I moonlight as a drummer, journalist, writer, and game developer. If you want to hire me to do one of these things, shoot me an email! Otherwise, feel free to browse my GitHub profile. You can reach me via email. I also have a LinkedIn profile for networking-purposes, but I rarely interact with it. You can see some of the code I've written in GitHub. My Twitter account is reserved for journalism.
