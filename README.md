My name is Michael, and I'm many things. I work a day-job as a devops engineer. I moonlight as a drummer, [journalist](https://muckrack.com/michaelbassili), writer, and [game developer](https://aquinasgames.ca/). If you want to hire me to do one of these things, shoot me an email! Otherwise, feel free to browse my GitHub profile. I also have a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-bassili/) profile for networking-purposes, but I rarely interact with it. You can see some of the code I've written in GitHub. My [Twitter](https://twitter.com/michaelbassili) account is reserved for journalism.
