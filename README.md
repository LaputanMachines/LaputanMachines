<h2> Hi, I'm Michael Bassili <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/mGcNjsfWAjY5AEZNw6/giphy.gif" width="50"> I Develop Software For Money</h2>

I've been developing software professionally since 2017. Nowadays, I'm primarily a cloud developer who uses a mixture of AWS and Azure resources. Most of my code's written in Python, but I've worked on projects written in Go, C, Groovy, and PHP throughout the years. My "specialty" is CICD Jenkins development. I've built reliable and cost-effective AWS auto-scaling groups which scaled according to developer use. These systems were self-healing and idempotent too. I take pride in the quality of documentation I write; in my opinion, a project isn't complete until there's a beautiful Markdown document describing every little detail.
