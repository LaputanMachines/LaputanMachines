# Hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm Michael B.

Iâ€™m a software engineer and cloud architect with a versatile background spanning data engineering, backend development, and cloud computing. Iâ€™ve built cool things with AWS, Azure and GCP. Iâ€™ve been working in tech since 2017. I do a lot of things, but Iâ€™m most passionate about building scalable, reliable, and secure cloud-native applications. Most importantly, I try to be a good human being and help others whenever I can.

Iâ€™ve been fortunate to work with some amazing people and companies. At the end of the day, Iâ€™m just a guy who loves to learn and build things. This blog is a place for me to share my thoughts, experiences, and learnings with the world.
