# Hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm Michael B.

Iâ€™m a software engineer and cloud architect with a versatile background spanning data engineering, backend development, and cloud computing. 
Iâ€™ve built cool things with AWS, Azure and GCP. 
Iâ€™ve been working in tech since 2017. 
I do a lot of things, but Iâ€™m most passionate about building scalable, reliable, and secure cloud-native applications.
